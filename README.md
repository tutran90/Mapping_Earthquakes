# **Mapping Earthquakes**

## **Purpose**
The purpose of the this project was to create map that displayed the different earthquake magnitudes and their locations. 

## **Results**
The project was completed utilizing different Javascript libraries: Leaflet, D3 (Data-Driven Documents). Mapbox was also used to gain access to the world map and all it's attributes (streets, satellite, navigation, etc.) The final map displays the earthquakes that occured over the past week with magnitudes up to 6 and the tectonic plates. The map can also be viewed in three styles (tile layers): street view, satellite view, and dark view. 

The following image displays the final [map](https://github.com/tutran90/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/Earthquake_Challege/static/js/D3_3rd_TileLayer.png).
